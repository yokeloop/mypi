# mypi

A project-centered memory and request system for explicit user-directed work.
[Development guidance](AGENTS.md) · [Workflow withdrawal](docs/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md) ·
[Roadmap](PLAN.md) · [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

**Implemented:** local memory, organizations/projects, DB request cards/statuses,
scoped journal, context Git, backup/restore, CLI and 31 stdio MCP tools over one API.
These are optional tools, not a mandatory agent workflow. Connecting mypi does not
require task registration, memory warmup, automatic logging or a separate Herdr tab.
The former instruction-driven workflow has been withdrawn; stored data is retained.

**Future:** units, project flows, runtime enforcement and agents with different scopes.
Flow is part of the product direction; automated execution/visibility isolation are
not implemented. See [PLAN](PLAN.md) for milestones without speculative infrastructure.

**Readiness:** the stdio MCP server and withdrawal of the mandatory agent workflow
are included since v0.1.1. This project is not production-ready: the independent App
issuer/trusted gate and final M1 acceptance remain open ([M1-CI](docs/M1-CI.md)). The earlier
[v0.1.0-rc.1](https://github.com/yokeloop/mypi/releases/tag/v0.1.0-rc.1) was a
release candidate. [Release snapshot](docs/RELEASE.md), [file-map snapshot](docs/FILEMAP.md)
and [published RC report](https://draft.yokeloop.com/artifacts/mypi-m1-bqso2mhf)
describe older revisions, not the current operating policy.

## Working model

- **State in SQLite; knowledge in files.** DB owns cards/statuses/relationships;
  Markdown does not duplicate live status. DB needs its own backup.
- **Request records are explicit data operations.** A card or saved capture does not
  launch work, create a session or authorize execution.
- **Project context is a directory.** MEMORY, glossary, notes, decisions and request
  materials live under home/projects/<org>/<project>, separate from the source checkout.
- **History records outcomes.** One factual outcome with evidence paths, not a narration
  of activity. Request history comes from a shared append-only JSONL journal.
- **Published artifacts remain addressable.** New versions use new paths. Mutable
  memory/context can change with history; original source and append-only logs cannot.
- **Saving is not synchronization.** Context writes include local Git commits;
  DB-only changes use transactions. Network sync requires separate authorization.
- **Future acceptance belongs to unit contracts.** A unit defines role, interface,
  restrictions and acceptance; it is not a running agent or a Pi extension. No
  universal human-only rule, and no acceptance that grants new external permissions.

## Develop and verify

TypeScript strict, Node.js 24 LTS, ESM/tsc, pnpm, SQLite + better-sqlite3, SQL migrations
without ORM; node:test + node:assert/strict. Modular monolith with Ports & Adapters.
Versions are pinned in mise.toml, package.json and the lockfile.

To publish a new version from a clean `main` with GitHub CLI authenticated:

```bash
mise exec -- pnpm release 0.1.2 # replace with the next version
```

The command updates package/MCP versions, builds and verifies, commits and tags that
same commit, pushes both refs atomically, waits for hosted CI on that SHA and creates
a GitHub prerelease (no npm publish). Tags are never moved. After a partial remote
write, inspect the reported state and rerun the same command to continue; it does not
roll back published refs. This is release automation, not an independent trusted gate.

From the engine checkout:

```bash
timeout --kill-after=5s 295s mise install
timeout --kill-after=5s 295s mise exec -- pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
mise exec -- pnpm build
mise exec -- pnpm verify
```

Read [TESTING](docs/TESTING.md) before test changes. test runs fast only; verify runs
admission + fast + boundary. Linux user systemd, cgroup v2 and bubblewrap are required;
no unsafe fallback. Build changed source/tests first; stale dist is rejected. Tests
create disposable installations and must not use the personal DB/home.

CLI help: `mise exec -- node dist/src/cli/main.js --help`.
[CLI and recovery](docs/M1-CLI.md) · [MCP and project-local Pi setup](docs/MCP.md).
Reads do not initialize missing storage. Bootstrap/restore/registration require explicit
intent. Do not modify global Pi instructions/configuration for local instruction upkeep.

$XDG_STATE_HOME/mypi/state.sqlite3 # outside both Git repositories
```

A card's context_dir locates source.md and artifacts. Its current status is in DB;
history is in the common monthly UTC journal. Standalone REQ records remain supported
by the storage/API, independently of any agent workflow.
Scoped warmup inherits parent MEMORY, not global inbox or sibling context. Global
journal means global entries only; reading all history is explicit.

The old prototype, import and format compatibility were removed by user request.
M1 SQL schema migrations and backup/restore remain. Historical evidence is not
permission to restore the old model.
